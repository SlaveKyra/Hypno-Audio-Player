# Hypno-Audio-Player
A small script i made for me but figured i might share this with you silly little Girls.

This script will play your own Hypno audio files randomly during a specified timeframe.
Great for some enforced hypno sessions.

PLEASE USE WITH CARE!

For example:
I use this to automatically start some of my Hypnos Randomly between 00:00 and 04:00 oclock with a 3% chance to start the audio every Minute during this Time.
I have this in my Autostart so i dont have to worry about it running.(And this way i can't forget to start it)

You can set your own Filepath for ur own Audios. This will scan folders and subfolders.

This will run hidden in the background so you dont get disturbed by a ugly popup.
